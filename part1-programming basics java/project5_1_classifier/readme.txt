 * Some people (especially in Europe and Latin America) write a 7     *
 * with a line through the middle, while others (especially in Japan  *
 * and Korea) make the top line crooked.                              *
 *                                                                    *
 * Suppose that the training data consists solely of samples that do  *
 * not use any of these conventions. How well do you think the        *
 * algorithm will perform when you test it on different populations?  *
 * What are the possible consequences?                                *
 **********************************************************************/

ANSWER: The algorightm might misclassify some numbers and show bias towards
numbers of traditional conventions

 * Now suppose that you are using a supervised learning algorithm to  *
 * diagnose cancer. Suppose the training data consists of examples    *
 * solely on individuals from population X but you use it on          *
 * individuals from population Y. What are the possible consequences? *
 **********************************************************************/

ANSWER: Algorithms accuracy on population Y will be greatly compromised

 *  anyone else? If so, please list their names.  ("A Sunday lab TA"

Yes or no?
No



/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you encounter any serious problems? If so, please describe.
 **********************************************************************/

Yes or no?

Yes, the project documentation (Project 5 - Image Classification - Part 1.docs)
was a bit too confusing to understand. It could have been rewritten in a more
straighforward and clear way.
